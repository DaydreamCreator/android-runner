# Android Runner
Android Runner (AR) is a tool for automatically executing measurement-based experiments on native and web apps running on Android devices.

The following scientific publication gives an overview about the main components, plugins, and configurations of Android Runner (as of 2020): [A-Mobile 2020 publication](https://github.com/S2-group/android-runner/blob/master/documentation/A_Mobile_2020.pdf)  

A complete tutorial on how to use Android Runner is available in the following YouTube playlist: [Android Runner Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZXT176ljjI&list=PLLbZZOioDh3P50WcYbuBMZEJokJH3ZONr).

As visualized below, Android Runner consists of the following components:
- **Experiment orchestrator**: Is in charge of executing the whole experiment according to the experiment configuration provided by the user.
- **Devices manager**: Is responsible for providing a layer of abstraction on the low-level operations involving the Android devices.
- **Progress manager**: Keeps track of the execution of each run of the experiment.
- **Plugin handler**: Provides a set of facilities for managing the profilers and an extension point that third-party developers can use for integrating their own measurement tools into Android Runner.
